            Over and over, you wanted it so fast
            Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
            Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
            Then make a sad face.............

            Over and over, you wanted it so fast
            Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
            Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
            Then make a sad face and tell me it's too late

            Right now and right here
            My love oh my dear
            I'll try to be clear
            My love oh my dear

            Over and over, you wanted me play
            Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
            Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
            Then we can jump and pretend we disagree

            Right now and right here
            My love oh my dear
            I'll try to be clear

            Over and over, we're turning off the light
            Even the warriors are always great at night
            Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
            Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon

            Right now and right here
            My love oh my dear...

            Faces under water
            Look much closer when they appear
            Your hand on my shoulder
            We'll be older in a year
            In the morning after
            Should I laugh or disappear ?

            您若要執行jQuery的fade效果
            請參考下列範例:
        <code>
           
        
            $('fieldset').hide();
            $('#Button1').click(function () {
            $('fieldset').fadeIn(1000);
            });
            $('#Reset1').click(function () {
            $('fieldset').fadeOut(1000);
            });
            $('#btn').click(function () {
            $('#thing').fadeToggle(1000);
            });
            function fadeShow() {
            var n = Math.random();
            $('#thing').fadeTo(300, n);
