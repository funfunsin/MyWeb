                    Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
                    Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
                    Then we can jump and pretend we disagree

                    Right now and right here
                    My love oh my dear
                    I'll try to be clear

                    Over and over, we're turning off the light
                    Even the warriors are always great at night
                    Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
                    Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon

                    Right now and right here
                    My love oh my dear...

                    Faces under water
                    Look much closer when they appear
                    Your hand on my shoulder
                    We'll be older in a year
                    In the morning after
                    Should I laugh or disappear ?
