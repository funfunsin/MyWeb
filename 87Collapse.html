                        Look much closer when they appear
                        Your hand on my shoulder
                        We'll be older in a year
                        In the morning after
                        Should I laugh or disappear ?
                        Over and over, you wanted it so fast
                        Head on my shoulder, I'll pour myself a glass
                        Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to a lake
                        Then make a sad face and tell me it's too late

                        Right now and right here
                        My love oh my dear
                        I'll try to be clear
                        My love oh my dear

                        Over and over, you wanted me play
                        Head on my shoulder, there's nothing left to say
                        Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the sea
                        Then we can jump and pretend we disagree

                        Right now and right here
                        My love oh my dear
                        I'll try to be clear

                        Over and over, we're turning off the light
                        Even the warriors are always great at night
                        Wait 'til we're somewhere closer to the moon
                        Then you can kiss me and say that it's too soon

                        Right now and right here
                        My love oh my dear...

                        Faces under water
                        Look much closer when they appear
                        Your hand on my shoulder
                        We'll be older in a year
                        In the morning after
                        Should I laugh or disappear ?
